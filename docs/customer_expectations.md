TRACTOR PULL DISTANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
Date: December 29, 2025
What You're Getting
A wireless distance measurement system for tractor pulls with two units:
Sled Unit - Mounts on the sled, reads the measuring wheel, shows distance on screen
Judge Unit - Sits at the judge's table, shows the same distance, has a reset button for the next pull
Both units talk to each other wirelessly so there's no cables across the track.

What I'll Build
Hardware:
Wire up both units on breadboards (working prototypes, not final boxes)
Connect your encoder to read the measuring wheel
Set up the displays and buttons
Test everything works together
Software:
Program both controllers
Make them talk to each other wirelessly
Calculate distance from wheel rotation
Let you reset from the judge's position
Make it easy to adjust for your wheel size
Handoff:
Show you video demos as I complete features
Put all the code on GitHub so you can access it
Write instructions for updating the software if needed
Walk you through how it works
What's NOT Included
This is a proof of concept to make sure everything works. It won't have:
Weatherproof boxes (still on breadboards)
Batteries (will use USB power for now)
Support for multiple sleds
Additional features may be considered at will of the contractor at standard rate by request.
